# Password Manager

A secure password management system that stores user credentials (username, password, and website URL) locally in the browser's local storage. In the future, the system will evolve into a cloud-based platform with encrypted storage and a master ID and password for secure access.

## Features

- **Local Storage**: Stores user credentials locally in the browser for now.
- **Future Plans**: Transition to a cloud-based storage system with encryption for enhanced security.
- **Master ID and Password**: Users will authenticate with a master ID and password to access their stored credentials.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system
- A code editor like VS Code

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Deployed URL

> Replace `#` with the actual deployed URL once available.

## Usage

1. Add credentials (username, password, and website URL) to the system.
2. View, edit, or delete credentials directly within the app.
3. In the future:
   - Use your master ID and password to securely log in.
   - Access your encrypted credentials from anywhere.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cloud Storage**:
   - Migrate from local storage to a secure cloud-based database.
   - Store user data in an encrypted format.

2. **Encryption**:
   - Implement strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) for secure storage.

3. **Master Authentication**:
   - Add functionality for users to sign in with a master ID and password.
   - Provide an extra layer of security with two-factor authentication (2FA).

4. **Improved UI/UX**:
   - Design a user-friendly interface with responsive features.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **State Management**: Context API/Redux (planned)
- **Storage**: Local Storage (for now)
- **Encryption**: Planned for future implementation
